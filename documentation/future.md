# Future

It would be interesting to make BASIC available in more places, such as web
assembly. 


LLVM could be used to generate code for multiple backends, including wasm.
I see no particular need for using basic to script web applications, but 
the idea amuses me. 

Using LLVM to build a compiler would provide much better
performance. Not that anyone uses BASIC to get high performance.
