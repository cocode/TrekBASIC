# Future

## Targets
By using python and LLVM, we can run TrekBasic almost anywhere. 

We'd like to run in the browser, as some point. While I see no particular need for using basic to script web applications, but 
the idea amuses me. 

## Dialects
There are so many dialects of basic, with not just minor differences, like the name of a function,
but complete changes like not requiring line numbers, or supporting multiple-character
variable names. Things that you can't just extend one interpreter to support both, since they
are fundamentally incompatible.
