# Future

It would be interesting to make BASIC available in more places, such as web
assembly. 


LLVM could be used to generate code for multiple backends, including wasm.
I see no particular need for using basic to script web applications, but 
the idea amuses me. 

Using LLVM to build a compiler would provide much better
performance. Not that anyone uses BASIC to get high performance. 

It would be nice to have pluggable parsers. 
Every old basic had a slightly different syntax, 
and you can't support more than a few, because eventually they 
conflict. Ideally, you would just plug in a grammar,
and it would work. This only works if it's only
a syntactic different, not a semantic.
