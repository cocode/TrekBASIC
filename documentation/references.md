## Online versions of BASIC

These are very handy for comparing behavior 

### 8 Bit Workshop
This lets you run your basic programs in the browser. You can even
select the dialect you want to use (if you know it!)

* https://8bitworkshop.com/docs/platforms/basic/index.html
* Supports multiple dialects explicitly
* This is a really nice implementation!

### Quite Basic 
https://www.quitebasic.com/
Similar to 8 Bit Workshop.

### Rob Hageman
https://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic/
Open source, written in python. This emulates the IBM PC from the 80s, 
with graphics support!

## Online versions of Star Trek
This is a really nice version of Star Trek in the browser. I believe it's a rewrite in JavaScript.

## Other Versions of BASIC
There are so many of them:

## BNF
Don't worry if you don't know about BNF. It's for future development. 
In particular, it's for supporting multiple versions of BASIC.

### Tek 4051 Basic
https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/tektronix-4051-basic-compiler-concept2.1248495/
Why? Because this is the machine I used to play star trek on, in school. 
Cool, modern (then) vector display with a state-of-the-art storage tube and a great tape drive! :-)
