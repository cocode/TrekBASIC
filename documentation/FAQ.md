# Frequently Asked Questions

1. Why can't this run other versions of Star Trek?
    
    It's not that hard to add another version. The challenge is figuring out what features
    and behaviors that version of Star Trek requires. 
       
    For example, some versions of BAISC use
    zero-based arrays, some use one-based. Unfortunately, sometimes adding suppport for one version
    means breaking support for another.


2. Is exponentiation right associative?
   
    No, it's left associative, like older dialects of basic.
