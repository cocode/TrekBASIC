# Task List

Don't start working on these, without asking first
### smart split doesn't handle nesting,. 
nesting is needed when enquote is not equal to dequite

### DIM

### Else
Else is not yet impleted.
### Renumber 
Renumber is not working correctly
### stmts command
The 'stmts' command prints an extra : before the goto on something simple like "100 if x=1 then goto 100"
### READ vs INPUT
Looks like Dartmouth basic uses READ instead of INPUT. We could add that without conflict. If the semantics are the
same, we could just alias.
### Escaped quotes
Should I support \" in Strings? I don't recall older basics doing that, but some do.

### READ, DATA, RESTORE
need to implement for hunt the wumpus
