This is going to be my attempt to port the original "star trek" game, in basic, to python.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)

There are several versions available.

startrek.bas: http://www.bobsoremweb.com/startrek.html
supertrek: http://www.vintage-basic.net/bcg/superstartrek.bas

Two options:
1. Port the code
2. Write a basic interpreter

2 sounds like more fun

TODO on interpreter.
1. Expressions will probably be the hardest
    a. Expression evaulation
    b. Expression assignment
    c. Array assignment.
2. Convert the program execution to a class.
3. Write smaller test programs.
4. Implement functions (RAND)
5. Implement subroutines (GOSUB)
