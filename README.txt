This is going to be my attempt to port the original "star trek" game, in basic, to python.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)

There are several versions available.

startrek.bas: http://www.bobsoremweb.com/startrek.html
supertrek: http://www.vintage-basic.net/bcg/superstartrek.bas

Two options:
1. Port the code
2. Write a basic interpreter

2 sounds like more fun
